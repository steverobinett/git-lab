        Hello all,
        My name is Zach Jewett. Moving from Washington when I was young, I grew up and graduated high school here and, have been in Great Falls for over 20 years.
        I took a quick hiatus to MSU Bozeman where I had two unsuccessful years. I then tried my hand, and failed, at a culinary school in Denver for a year. 
        I was just way too interested in the non-academic aspects of university, I guess. However, thanks to a spattering of transfer credits from Bozeman and 
        a handful of AP courses, I am able to pursue two Associate’s at the same time here. I will graduate with both of these this spring and then will seek 
        redemption in Bozeman, continuing my CS degree. I am a rabid hockey fan, history enthusiast, and avid reader. A bit of a geek, I am strong with the Force 
        and an expert on the lore of Middle-Earth. I desperately want to help colonize Mars, but the gal pal and Elon Musk say I’m not allowed to. 
        So, I’ve settled for wanting to live in a lighthouse in Sweden. Cheers!
